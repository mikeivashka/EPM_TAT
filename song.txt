Another day, another post-traumatic order
Brainwashed and feeling fine
I bit off more than I could chew when I looked closer
So I stabbed a fork in my eye

[Pre-Chorus: Oliver Sykes]
Think I'm losing my fucking mind
Don't know where to turn, now I'm blind
Destroy yourself
It feels so good to fade away
Why do you wanna hurt yourself?
Die for something else?
Don't let your conscience
Get in the way
